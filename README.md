# password-generator
password-generator is a tool which allows users to generate passwords and then save their entries to a text file.

## In more detail
The program lets the user enter what the password is for, what username they use and then generates them a secure password. They can do this as many times as they want and display all the entries they have made. When they are ready, they will have the option to save these to a text file which they can use to store their passwords or go on to enter them into a passsword manager/write them out on paper.

## Aims of the project
I want to use this project to work on learning and applying things that are considered 'best practice' when it comes to programming. In particular, I want to get better at dividing my program into multiple smaller subroutines that each serve a specific purpose rather than writing one big subroutine that does many things (which makes it harder to understand and maintain).
